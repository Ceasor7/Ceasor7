**`Full Stack Web Developer/Art Enthusiast)`**

As a FullStack Junior Web Developer, I specialize in programming and design content creation using the latest web technologies. I am continually excited to utilize new technologies in order to solve problems in the design, development, and deployment phases of web applications.
I am skilled in using JavaScript frameworks and libraries like ReactJs and NextJs to create visually appealing user interfaces that are easy for users to navigate. On the backend of web applications, I prefer using NodeJS and ExpressJs to facilitate communication between frontend components and the database.
