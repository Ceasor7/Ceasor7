- 👋 Hi there! I'm Joseph Gateru and I have one year of experience as a web developer, and I focus on JavaScript frameworks like ReactJs and NextJs. I'm interested about creating top-notch online applications and using technology to make daily tasks simpler. I enjoy the rush of seeing a project through from conception to deployment.
-  I'm presently learning React-Native to expand my skill set and create cross-platform applications in addition to my knowledge of web programming. I'm eager to investigate the potential of creating high-performance mobile applications that function flawlessly across many platforms with React-Native.
- 💞️ When I'm not coding, I love to explore new technologies and experiment with different tools and frameworks. I believe that continuous learning is key to staying ahead in the fast-paced world of technology.
-  Feel free to explore my projects and contributions on GitHub. Let's connect and collaborate on building something amazing!"
